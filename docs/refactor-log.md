### Notes:
- Several bugs were identified and fixed during testing, mostly related to missing `store_id` scoping or incorrect method signatures in the Phase 4 refactor.
- Database seeding required fixes to accommodate the strict `owner_id` requirement in the `stores` table and the Spatie Teams configuration.
- Cart items required manual force-deletion during tests due to unique index constraints not ignoring soft-deleted rows.
- All core business flows (Auth -> Cart -> Checkout -> Status) are now verified and working in the multi-store architecture.

## Fix Remaining Architecture Violations — 2026-05-03
### What I Did:
- Audited CheckoutService for direct Model queries violating architecture rules
- Created create() method in OrderItemRepository to handle single order item creation
- Injected OrderItemRepository into CheckoutService constructor
- Replaced direct OrderItem::create() call with repository method call
- Verified no remaining direct Model queries exist in CheckoutService
- Confirmed AddToCartAction already uses UserRepository correctly (previously fixed)

### Violations Fixed:
- `app/Services/CheckoutService.php` — Replaced direct `OrderItem::create()` call with `$this->orderItemRepository->create()` to comply with "NO DB QUERIES OUTSIDE REPOSITORIES" rule

### Files Created:
- None (OrderItemRepository already existed, only added new method)

### Files Modified:
- `app/Repositories/OrderItem/OrderItemRepository.php` — Added `create(array $data): OrderItem` method for single order item creation
- `app/Services/CheckoutService.php` — Injected OrderItemRepository dependency and replaced direct `OrderItem::create()` with repository call

### Migrations Created:
- None

### Notes:
- AddToCartAction was already compliant with architecture (UserRepository was previously injected)
- The only remaining violation was the `OrderItem::create()` call in CheckoutService's `createCheckoutSession()` method
- Stripe API calls remain in the service layer as permitted by architecture (external API calls are not DB queries)
- The try/catch block for Stripe exceptions remains in the service layer as explicitly allowed by architecture rules
- All database queries now properly flow through repositories as required
